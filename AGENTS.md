## Attribution

This section was authored by Mia's AI Lab. Source: https://mia-ai.net/lab/downloads/agents-md-credit-and-attribution (fetched 2026-10-04; that page does not publish a commit SHA). Profiles: https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab and https://x.com/MiaAI_lab.

Credit is part of the task. A name the user required is required. Finish only after a second read of the edited files proves the credit is present, worded as authorship, and placed where a reader sees it before the install steps.

### Write the credit

- Name the person, their handle, and the work they authored. Link the profile, repo, and commit when those were given. Do not invent a commit SHA.
- Say they authored that work, or that the imported files came from them. Use the role already in the source. Do not invent a new one.
- Put each required name on the first screen of the README, before the install or quick-start steps. Also put it in the credits section the user named.
- Keep every name and credit already listed, including NVIDIA and other upstream credits. Move an existing sentence when asked; keep its wording and any link it already has.
- When the same missing credit is in another repo under the same account, fix that copy too and open its own pull request.

### Leave the wording plain

These are not credits. Replace them with the author's name:

- "informed"
- "inspired"
- "based on ideas from"
- "lineage" with no author

### Check the files again

Before saying the work is done, re-read the changed files from disk, or the pull request diff, and confirm each line:

1. Every required name appears, with the required links.
2. The name is above the install steps on the first screen.
3. The credits section still contains every name that was there before.
4. The words "informed" and "inspired" are gone from that credit.
5. The diff touches only the text files for the credit. Scripts, model ids, defaults, and git history are unchanged.
6. Each repo that had the same omission has its own commit or pull request.

If any line fails, fix it and read the file again. Do not report success from memory of the edit.
